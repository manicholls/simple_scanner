# simple_scanner


This is a simple website that allows a user to initiate a scan against an HP MFP

Install hplip and run hp-setup first to connect the printer

Install nginx (others could be used instead)

copy index.html to the root of the web website

copy scan.cgi to your cgi-bin directory

make sure there is a scan directory in the html root as well for dumping the documents.


This could be so much more complicated (and feature rich) but meets my needs for now.
